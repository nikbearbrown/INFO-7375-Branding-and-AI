# Exercise 2.2: Vision Testing
## Objective

Validate the vision statement through stakeholder mapping, value alignment, feasibility analysis, and market relevance testing.

## Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is the process of identifying and organizing all the key individuals, groups, or organizations that are affected by or can influence a project, business, or brand. It visualizes their roles, involvement, and importance to ensure effective communication and collaboration.

**Purpose:**
To identify and categorize stakeholders based on their influence, interest, and relationship to the project or vision.

Tool Used: Miro

Action:

Used Miro to map key stakeholders (local artisans, consumers, environmental groups).
Created connections between stakeholders and their roles.


Local Artisans: Product creators.
Consumers: Buyers of affordable, sustainable fashion.
Environmental Groups: Advocates for eco-friendly practices.

The Miro stakeholder map provides a visual representation of the relationships between the brand and its stakeholders, ensuring alignment with its vision and facilitating decision-making for sustainable and impactful strategies. Let me know if you'd like further customization!



## Step 2: Value Alignment

Value alignment is the process of ensuring that the vision, goals, and actions of a project or brand align with the core values of the stakeholders and the organization itself.

**Purpose:**
To confirm that the brandâ€™s actions resonate with its values (e.g., sustainability, inclusivity, affordability) and those of its stakeholders.

Tool Used: ChatGPT

Action:
Simulated stakeholder feedback for value alignment.

Prompt Example:
"Simulate customer feedback for the vision: 'We strive to make sustainable fashion accessible and inclusive.'"

AI Feedback:

Artisans: "Does this include fair compensation?"
Consumers: "Can affordability maintain quality?"
Environmental Groups: "How will circular economy goals be measured?"


## Step 3: Practical Application

Practical application involves creating actionable steps and processes to implement a vision or goal, ensuring that the strategy is feasible and realistic.

**Purpose:**
To translate the vision and strategy into concrete actions that can be executed effectively.

Tool Used: Trello for action planning and ChatGPT for outlining steps.
Action:
Created a checklist in Trello for implementation feasibility.
