# Aquatic Brewery questions

What taproom features and experiences drive customer visit decisions?  

- What factors influence how consumers choose a brewery taproom? (e.g., outdoor space, live music, board games, arcade games, etc.) Are the added costs of these features worth the investment?  
- What creates a memorable taproom experience? How do various aspects of the taproom shape customer satisfaction and visit patterns? Do they encourage return visits?
