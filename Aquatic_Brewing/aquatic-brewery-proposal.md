# AI Concierge Proposal for Aquatic Brewery
## Enhancing Customer Experience While Gathering Valuable Insights

### Executive Summary

Aquatic Brewery faces a unique challenge: despite receiving high ratings on general AI platforms like ChatGPT, competitors are being recommended more frequently. Meanwhile, the brewery seeks to better understand what drives customer visit decisions to optimize their taproom experience. This proposal outlines how a custom AI concierge can transform both the customer experience and Aquatic's understanding of patron preferences.

By implementing an AI concierge solution, Aquatic Brewery can create personalized experiences around their diverse beer menu while gathering rich, contextual data about customer preferences, behaviors, and visit drivers. Our research indicates this dual-purpose approach would provide significant advantages over both relying on generic AI platforms and conducting traditional surveys.

### Current Situation

#### The Customer Experience Challenge

Aquatic Brewery offers an impressive range of craft beers, from New England IPAs like Galaxy Aronnax and Aronnax to unique offerings like Hibiscus Shrewd Saison and Raspberry-Blackberry Downwelling fruited sour. However:

1. **Customer Overwhelm**: New visitors may find the diverse menu intimidating
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Customers may not understand the nuances between styles (e.g., Session IPA vs. New Zealand Pale Ale)
3. **Discovery Limitations**: Valuable beers like Giant Choctopus (Barrel Aged Chocolate Stout) might be overlooked
4. **Generic Recommendations**: Customers using ChatGPT receive recommendations that favor competitors

#### The Data Collection Challenge

Simultaneously, Aquatic Brewery wants to understand what taproom features and experiences drive customer visit decisions, but faces limitations with current data collection methods:

1. **Survey Fatigue**: Traditional surveys yield low response rates and limited insights
2. **Point-in-Time Data**: Current methods only provide snapshots rather than ongoing feedback
3. **Self-Reporting Bias**: What customers say influences their decisions may differ from actual behavior
4. **Missed Opportunities**: Valuable feedback during the customer experience goes uncaptured

### Research Problem

> **How would an AI concierge that provides personalized recommendations and information about Aquatic Brewery's diverse beer offerings affect customer satisfaction, exploration behavior, and visit frequency compared to traditional taproom interactions?**

This research problem directly supports Aquatic's main decision problem: "What taproom features and experiences drive customer visit decisions?" by examining how enhanced digital interactions influence customer behavior and satisfaction.

### The AI Concierge Solution

#### For Customers: Enhanced Experience

The AI concierge would transform how customers interact with Aquatic's diverse beer menu:

1. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - "Based on your enjoyment of Galaxy Aronnax, you might like to try Gyre, our Double New England IPA"
   - "Since you prefer lower ABV options, consider our Dock Rock Session IPA at 4.5%"

2. **Style Education**:
   - "Curious about 'Helles Lager'? It's a traditional German pale lager known for its subtle malty sweetness and clean finish"
   - "The 'Barrel Aged Amber Lager' (Supremely Common) gets its unique flavor from time spent in whiskey barrels"

3. **Food Pairing Suggestions**:
   - "Our Woods Hole Oatmeal Stout pairs wonderfully with chocolate desserts"
   - "The Raspberry-Blackberry Downwelling sour complements cheese plates perfectly"

4. **Memory and Personalization**:
   - "Welcome back! Last time you enjoyed our Tawaki New Zealand Pale Ale. We just tapped a new batch"
   - "Since you mentioned enjoying coffee notes, our Pie in the Sky Nitro Coffee Stout might interest you"

5. **Event Information**:
   - "We're hosting a brewer's talk about barrel aging techniques this Saturday, featuring Giant Choctopus"
   - "Next week we're releasing a variant of Bay to Bay State with local honey"

### Survey Questions to Assess AI Recommendation Impact

We recommend conducting the following survey to understand how AI recommendations influence customer perceptions and whether a custom AI concierge would provide value:

   "Have you ever consulted a language model (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude) for local dining or brewery recommendations?"
   - Yes
   - No

   *Rationale: Identifies user adoption of AI-generated recommendations and how that relates to Aquatic Brewing appearing in recommendations.*

2. **Custom AI Preference**
   "How strongly would you prefer using a custom AI concierge specifically designed for Aquatic Brewery over a generic language model (like ChatGPT) for brewery recommendations?"
   - Strongly prefer generic LLM (1)
   - Somewhat prefer generic LLM (2)
   - No preference (3)
   - Somewhat prefer custom AI concierge (4)
