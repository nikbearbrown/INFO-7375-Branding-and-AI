# The **Harvard Graduate Student Housing Survey** (2005) was designed to assess housing preferences, experiences, and constraints of Harvard graduate students, updating a prior survey from 2001. The survey aimed to inform Harvard Real Estate Services (HRES) on optimizing student housing while supporting the **Allston Initiative**, a major expansion project across the Charles River.

### **Key Findings & Statistics from the 2001 Survey**
- **Housing Distribution:**
  - 44% of respondents lived in **Harvard-owned housing**.
  - 23% lived in **graduate residence halls** (mostly first-year and single students).
  - 19% lived in **Harvard Planning and Real Estate (HPRE) apartments** (more likely occupied by students with children).
  - 43% lived in **private-market rentals**, typically married students without children.

- **Rent & Costs:**
  - The **average rent for private-market housing was $1,453**, about $150 more than Harvard-owned housing ($1,303).
  - Rent trends indicated **higher increases than financial aid adjustments**, leading to affordability concerns.
  - **28% of students could pay between $600-$799** per month, with **nearly three-quarters paying between $400-$1,199**.

- **Satisfaction Ratings (1-5 scale, 5 = Very Satisfied):**
  - **Convenient location:** **4.3**
  - **Security:** **4.0**
  - **Close to public transit:** **4.0**
  - **Amount of space:** **3.8**
  - **Building management:** **3.8**
  - **Cost:** **3.3** (one of the lowest-rated aspects)
  - **Feeling part of Harvard community:** **3.3** (concern about lack of integration)

- **Housing Preferences & Trade-offs:**
  - **Ideal housing choices:**
    - 29% preferred a **Harvard studio/one-bedroom** apartment.
    - 25% opted for **private housing**.
    - 14% wanted a **Harvard two-bedroom apartment**.
  - **Trade-off preferences:**
    - **Rent vs. time to campus**: **48% prioritized rent**, **52% prioritized commute time**.
    - **Space vs. commute time**: **37% prioritized space**, **63% prioritized a shorter commute**.
    - **Space vs. rent**: **28% prioritized space**, **72% prioritized lower rent**.

- **Transportation:**
  - **62% of students walked** to campus.
  - **Preferred commute options (for a 15-minute commute, rated 1-5):**
    - **Walking (4.4)**
    - **Harvard shuttle (3.7)**
    - **Biking (3.2)**
    - **Driving (2.7)**
    - **Driving + MBTA (2.0)**

- **Expectations vs. Reality:**
  - Students unfamiliar with Boston had **higher expectations for modernity, space, and affordability**.
  - Only **30% of dental and divinity school students** said cost and availability had no impact on their decision to attend Harvard (vs. 59% of business school students).

### **Impact of the 2001 Survey on Housing Initiatives**
- **Design Innovations:**
  - Development of **double studios**, providing more space than dorms but at lower costs than full apartments.
  - **52 double studios introduced** at **29 Garden Street**, a renovated former hotel.
  - Cost-effective and flexible apartment designs were prioritized, ensuring adaptability for future housing needs.

- **Influence on Harvard’s Allston Expansion:**
  - The survey supported **plans for graduate housing in Allston**, incorporating elements of community housing models seen at MIT’s **Sidney-Pacific Graduate Community**.
  - Considerations for **graduate housing composition**, balancing student preferences for mixed-school versus single-school communities.

### **Challenges for the 2005 Survey**
- **New context:**
  - The **Allston Initiative** required long-term planning for future student housing.
  - Graduate student preferences had to be projected **10-25 years into the future**.

- **Survey Methodology:**
  - The **2001 survey** had a **38% response rate**, representative across gender, age, and year of study.
  - The **2005 survey** aimed to refine **price sensitivity metrics**, update amenities lists, and expand insights into social and lifestyle habits.

### **Conclusion**
The **Harvard Graduate Student Housing Survey** provided **critical data for improving student housing** at Harvard. The findings influenced **housing policy, real estate development, and student recruitment strategies**, particularly for the **Allston Initiative**. Key takeaways included **prioritizing affordability, commute convenience, and community integration**, while introducing **new, space-efficient housing designs** to accommodate evolving student needs.

I have created detailed tables summarizing the key findings from the Harvard Graduate Student Housing Survey. You can review the tables covering **housing distribution, rent & cost, satisfaction ratings, housing preferences, trade-off preferences, and transportation preferences** for a structured overview of the survey results.
